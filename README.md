Welcome to my final project for ANGM 2502! I decided to do a store page that people can post to their instagram, tiktok, or website/blog! One of the most annoying things is opening up photoshop and fiddling around with images and texts, and rinsing and repeating for every advertisement you make so they look the exact same. My program simplifies that to only 2 things a user needs to do; replace the images to their own, and if they want, change the font in the code!

How does it work? It's simple, replace the images with your own. For seamless and faster results, keep file names and types the same. Logos can be transparent! Changing font is a bit more know-how and completely optional, using Courier New by default. The font is rendered at the top of the code, simply change it and go to the textbox object classes and replace the specified font with your new one! Everything is laid out already, and ready to go when you run the program. It will prompt you with a few questions; what your shop name is, and prices for your 3 items. Finally, it will ask what size you would like your advertisement to be, with named presets such as Instagram post, phone size, and webpage size! 

## "Neat! How do I save it???" It does it for you! As soon as you close the program, it will save your shop page ad in the SRC folder as a PNG! 
### Have fun!
